# Content Sources

This directory contains source code, which is a mixture of DocBook and Markdown with
a bit of XSLT for layout rendering. DocBook has been used historically and Markdown
has been adopted for new pages without sophisticated structure (which is most of doc
guides).

If you are looking for the code that renders the site, see [./code](../code/) instead.

Stylesheets can be found under [./site/css](./css/) and JavaScript code under
[./site/js](./js/).
