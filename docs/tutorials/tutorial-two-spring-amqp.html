<p><div class="aside" style="margin-top: -10px;" xml:base="site/tutorials/tutorials-help.xml.inc">
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      This tutorial assumes RabbitMQ is <a href="/download.html">installed</a> and running
      on <span class="code ">localhost</span> on the <a href="/networking.html#ports">standard port</a> (<span class="code ">5672</span>). In case you use
      a different host, port or credentials, connections settings would require adjusting.
    </p>

<p>In the <a href="tutorial-one-spring-amqp.html">first tutorial</a> we
wrote programs to send and receive messages from a named queue. In this
one we'll create a <em>Work Queue</em> that will be used to distribute
time-consuming tasks among multiple workers.</p>
<p>The main idea behind Work Queues (aka: <em>Task Queues</em>) is to avoid
doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for
it to complete. Instead we schedule the task to be done later. We encapsulate a
<em>task</em> as a message and send it to a queue. A worker process running
in the background will pop the tasks and eventually execute the
job. When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.</p>
<p>This concept is especially useful in web applications where it's
impossible to handle a complex task during a short HTTP request
window.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>In the previous part of this tutorial we sent a message containing
"Hello World!". Now we'll be sending strings that stand for complex
tasks. We don't have a real-world task, like images to be resized or
PDF files to be rendered, so let's fake it by just pretending we're
busy - by using the <span class="code ">Thread.sleep()</span> function. We'll take the number of dots
in the string as its complexity; every dot will account for one second
of "work".  For example, a fake task described by <span class="code ">Hello...</span>
will take three seconds.</p>
<p>Please see the setup in <a href="tutorial-one-spring-amqp.html">first tutorial</a>
if you have not setup the project. We will follow the same pattern
as in the first tutorial: 1) create a package <span class="code ">tut2</span> and create
<span class="code ">Tut2Config</span>, <span class="code ">Tut2Receiver</span>, and <span class="code ">Tut2Sender</span> classes. Start by creating a new
package <span class="code ">tut2</span> where we'll place our three classes.  In the configuration
class we setup two profiles, the label for the tutorial <span class="code ">tut2</span> and
the name of the pattern (<span class="code ">work-queues</span>).  We leverage Spring to expose
the queue as a bean. We setup the receiver as a profile and define two beans
to correspond to the workers in our diagram above; <span class="code ">receiver1</span> and
<span class="code ">receiver2</span>. Finally, we define a profile for the sender and define the
sender bean.  The configuration is now done.</p>
<pre class="lang-java">
import org.springframework.amqp.core.Queue;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;

@Profile({"tut2", "work-queues"})
@Configuration
public class Tut2Config {

    @Bean
    public Queue hello() {
        return new Queue("hello");
    }

    @Profile("receiver")
    private static class ReceiverConfig {

        @Bean
        public Tut2Receiver receiver1() {
            return new Tut2Receiver(1);
        }

        @Bean
        public Tut2Receiver receiver2() {
            return new Tut2Receiver(2);
        }
    }

    @Profile("sender")
    @Bean
    public Tut2Sender sender() {
        return new Tut2Sender();
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Sender</h3>
<p>We will modify the sender to provide a means for identifying
whether it's a longer running task by appending a dot to the
message in a very contrived fashion using the same method
on the <span class="code ">RabbitTemplate</span> to publish the message, <span class="code ">convertAndSend</span>.
The documentation defines this as, "Convert a Java object to
a message and send it to a default exchange with a
default routing key."</p>
<pre class="lang-java">
package org.springframework.amqp.tutorials.tut2;

import org.springframework.amqp.core.Queue;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.RabbitTemplate;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class Tut2Sender {

    @Autowired
    private RabbitTemplate template;

    @Autowired
    private Queue queue;

    AtomicInteger dots = new AtomicInteger(0);

    AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 1000, initialDelay = 500)
    public void send() {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        if (dots.incrementAndGet() == 4) {
            dots.set(1);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; dots.get(); i++) {
            builder.append('.');
        }
        builder.append(count.incrementAndGet());
        String message = builder.toString();
        template.convertAndSend(queue.getName(), message);
        System.out.println(" [x] Sent '" + message + "'");
    }

}
</pre>

<h3>Receiver</h3>
<p>Our receiver, <span class="code ">Tut2Receiver</span>, simulates an arbitrary length for
a fake task in the <span class="code ">doWork()</span> method where the number of dots
translates into the number of seconds the work will take. Again,
we leverage a <span class="code ">@RabbitListener</span> on the <span class="code ">hello</span> queue and a
<span class="code ">@RabbitHandler</span> to receive the message. The instance that is
consuming the message is added to our monitor to show
which instance, the message and the length of time to process
the message.</p>
<pre class="lang-java">
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitHandler;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitListener;
import org.springframework.util.StopWatch;

@RabbitListener(queues = "hello")
public class Tut2Receiver {

    private final int instance;

    public Tut2Receiver(int i) {
        this.instance = i;
    }

    @RabbitHandler
    public void receive(String in) throws InterruptedException {
        StopWatch watch = new StopWatch();
        watch.start();
        System.out.println("instance " + this.instance +
            " [x] Received '" + in + "'");
        doWork(in);
        watch.stop();
        System.out.println("instance " + this.instance +
            " [x] Done in " + watch.getTotalTimeSeconds() + "s");
    }

    private void doWork(String in) throws InterruptedException {
        for (char ch : in.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '.') {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Compile them using mvn package and run with the following options</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
./mvnw clean package

# shell 1
java -jar target/rabbitmq-tutorials.jar --spring.profiles.active=work-queues,receiver
# shell 2
java -jar target/rabbitmq-tutorials.jar --spring.profiles.active=work-queues,sender
</pre>

<p>The output of the sender should look something like:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
Ready ... running for 10000ms
 [x] Sent 'Hello.1'
 [x] Sent 'Hello..2'
 [x] Sent 'Hello...3'
 [x] Sent 'Hello.4'
 [x] Sent 'Hello..5'
 [x] Sent 'Hello...6'
 [x] Sent 'Hello.7'
 [x] Sent 'Hello..8'
 [x] Sent 'Hello...9'
 [x] Sent 'Hello.10'
</pre>

<p>And the output from the workers should look something like:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
Ready ... running for 10000ms
instance 1 [x] Received 'Hello.1'
instance 2 [x] Received 'Hello..2'
instance 1 [x] Done in 1.001s
instance 1 [x] Received 'Hello...3'
instance 2 [x] Done in 2.004s
instance 2 [x] Received 'Hello.4'
instance 2 [x] Done in 1.0s
instance 2 [x] Received 'Hello..5'
</pre>

<h3>Message acknowledgment</h3>
<p>Doing a task can take a few seconds. You may wonder what happens if
one of the consumers starts a long task and dies with it only partly done.
Spring AMQP by default takes a conservative approach to <a href="../confirms.html">message acknowledgement</a>.
If the listener throws an exception the container
calls:</p>
<pre class="lang-java">
channel.basicReject(deliveryTag, requeue)
</pre>

<p>Requeue is true by default unless you explicitly set:</p>
<pre class="lang-java">
defaultRequeueRejected=false
</pre>

<p>or the listener throws an <span class="code ">AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException</span>. This
is typically the behavior you want from your listener. In this mode
there is no need to worry about a forgotten acknowledgement.  After
processing the message the listener calls:</p>
<pre class="lang-java">
channel.basicAck()
</pre>

<p>Acknowledgement must be sent on the same channel the delivery
was received on. Attempts to acknowledge using a different channel
will result in a channel-level protocol exception. See the <a href="../confirms.html">doc guide on confirmations</a> to learn more.
Spring AMQP generally takes care of this but when used in combination with code
that uses RabbitMQ Java client directly, this is something to keep in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Forgotten acknowledgment</h4>
<p>It's a common mistake to miss the <span class="code ">basicAck</span> and Spring AMQP
helps to avoid this through its default configuration.
The consequences are serious. Messages will be redelivered
when your client quits (which may look like random redelivery), but
RabbitMQ will eat more and more memory as it won't be able to release
any unacked messages.</p>
<p>In order to debug this kind of mistake you can use <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span>
to print the <span class="code ">messages_unacknowledged</span> field:</p>
<p><pre class="lang-bash">
sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
</pre></p>
<p>On Windows, drop the sudo:
<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl.bat list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
</pre></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Message persistence</h3>
<p>Messages are persistent by default with Spring AMQP. Note the queue
the message will end up in needs to be durable as well, otherwise
the message will not survive a broker restart as a non-durable queue does not
itself survive a restart.</p>
<p>To have more control over the message persistence or over aspects of outbound
messages, you need to use <span class="code ">RabbitTemplate#convertAndSend(...)</span> methods
that accept a <span class="code ">MessagePostProcessor</span> parameter. <span class="code ">MessagePostProcessor</span>
provides a callback before the message is actually sent, so this
is a good place to modify the message payload or headers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Note on message persistence</h4>
<p>Marking messages as persistent doesn't fully guarantee that a message
won't be lost. Although it tells RabbitMQ to save the message to disk,
there is still a short time window when RabbitMQ has accepted a message and
hasn't saved it yet. Also, RabbitMQ doesn't do <span class="code ">fsync(2)</span> for every
message -- it may be just saved to cache and not really written to the
disk. The persistence guarantees aren't strong, but it's more than enough
for our simple task queue. If you need a stronger guarantee then you can use
<a href="../confirms.html">publisher confirms</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fair dispatch vs Round-robin dispatching</h3>
<p>By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer,
in sequence. On average every consumer will get the same number of
messages. This way of distributing messages is called round-robin.
In this mode dispatching doesn't necessarily work exactly as we want.
For example in a situation with two workers, when all
odd messages are heavy and even messages are light, one worker will be
constantly busy and the other one will do hardly any work. Well,
RabbitMQ doesn't know anything about that and will still dispatch
messages evenly.</p>
<p>This happens because RabbitMQ just dispatches a message when the message
enters the queue. It doesn't look at the number of unacknowledged
messages for a consumer. It just blindly dispatches every n-th message
to the n-th consumer.</p>
<p>However, "Fair dispatch" is the default configuration for Spring AMQP. The
<span class="code ">AbstractMessageListenerContainer</span> defines the value for
<span class="code ">DEFAULT_PREFETCH_COUNT</span> to be 250.  If the <span class="code ">DEFAULT_PREFETCH_COUNT</span> were
set to 1 the behavior would be the round robin delivery as described above.</p>
<div class="diagram">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/prefetch-count.png" height="110" />
  <div class="diagram_source">
    digraph {
      bgcolor=transparent;
      truecolor=true;
      rankdir=LR;
      node [style="filled"];
      //
      P1 [label="P", fillcolor="#00ffff"];
      subgraph cluster_Q1 {
        label="queue_name=hello";
    color=transparent;
        Q1 [label="{||||}", fillcolor="red", shape="record"];
      };
      C1 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      C2 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      //
      P1 -&gt; Q1;
      Q1 -&gt; C1 [label="prefetch=1"] ;
      Q1 -&gt; C2 [label="prefetch=1"] ;
    }
  </div>
</div>

<blockquote>
<h4>Note about <span class="code ">prefetchCount</span> = 1</h4>
<p>In most of the cases <span class="code ">prefetchCount</span> equal to 1 would be too conservative and severely
limit consumer throughput.
A couple of cases where this configuration is applicable can be found in <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference/#async-consumer">Spring AMQP Consumer Documentation</a></p>
<p>For more details on prefetch, please refer to the <a href="../confirms.html#channel-qos-prefetch">Consumer Acknowledgements guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, with the <span class="code ">prefetchCount</span> set to 250 by default,
this tells RabbitMQ not to give more than 250 messages to a worker
at a time. Or, in other words, don't dispatch a new message to a
worker while the number of unacked messages is 250.
Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.</p>
<p>Desired <span class="code ">prefetchCount</span> value can be set via
<span class="code ">AbstractMessageListenerContainer.setPrefetchCount(int prefetchCount)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Note about queue size</h4>
<p>If all the workers are busy, your queue can fill up. You will want to keep an
eye on that, and maybe add more workers, or have some other strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using Spring AMQP you get reasonable values configured for
message acknowledgments and fair dispatching. The default durability
for queues and persistence for messages provided by Spring AMQP
allow the messages to survive even if RabbitMQ is restarted.</p>
