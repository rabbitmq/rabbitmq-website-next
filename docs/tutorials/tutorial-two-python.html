<h3>What This Tutorial Focuses On</h3>
<p>In the <a href="tutorial-one-python.html">first tutorial</a> we
wrote programs to send and receive messages from a named queue. In this
one we'll create a <em>Work Queue</em> that will be used to distribute
time-consuming tasks among multiple workers.</p>
<p>The main idea behind Work Queues (aka: <em>Task Queues</em>) is to avoid
doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for
it to complete. Instead we schedule the task to be done later. We encapsulate a
<em>task</em> as a message and send it to the queue. A worker process running
in the background will pop the tasks and eventually execute the
job. When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.</p>
<p>This concept is especially useful in web applications where it's
impossible to handle a complex task during a short HTTP request
window.</p>
<p>In the previous part of this tutorial we sent a message containing
"Hello World!". Now we'll be sending strings that stand for complex
tasks. We don't have a real-world task, like images to be resized or
pdf files to be rendered, so let's fake it by just pretending we're
busy - by using the <span class="code ">time.sleep()</span> function. We'll take the number of dots
in the string as its complexity; every dot will account for one second
of "work".  For example, a fake task described by <span class="code ">Hello...</span>
will take three seconds.</p>
<p>We will slightly modify the <em>send.py</em> code from our previous example,
to allow arbitrary messages to be sent from the command line. This
program will schedule tasks to our work queue, so let's name it
<span class="code ">new_task.py</span>:</p>
<pre class="lang-python">
import sys

message = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:]) or "Hello World!"
channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
                      routing_key='hello',
                      body=message)
print(" [x] Sent %r" % message)
</pre>

<p>Our old <em>receive.py</em> script also requires some changes: it needs to
fake a second of work for every dot in the message body. It will pop
messages from the queue and perform the task, so let's call it <span class="code ">worker.py</span>:</p>
<pre class="lang-python">
import time

def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(" [x] Received %r" % body.decode())
    time.sleep(body.count(b'.'))
    print(" [x] Done")
</pre>

<h2>Round-robin dispatching</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of using a Task Queue is the ability to easily
parallelise work. If we are building up a backlog of work, we can just
add more workers and that way, scale easily.</p>
<p>First, let's try to run two <span class="code ">worker.py</span> scripts at the same time. They
will both get messages from the queue, but how exactly? Let's see.</p>
<p>You need three consoles open. Two will run the <span class="code ">worker.py</span>
script. These consoles will be our two consumers - C1 and C2.</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
# shell 1
python worker.py
# =&gt; [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C
</pre>

<div></div>

<pre class="lang-bash">
# shell 2
python worker.py
# =&gt; [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C
</pre>

<p>In the third one we'll publish new tasks. Once you've started
the consumers you can publish a few messages:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
# shell 3
python new_task.py First message.
python new_task.py Second message..
python new_task.py Third message...
python new_task.py Fourth message....
python new_task.py Fifth message.....
</pre>

<p>Let's see what is delivered to our workers:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
# shell 1
python worker.py
# =&gt; [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C
# =&gt; [x] Received 'First message.'
# =&gt; [x] Received 'Third message...'
# =&gt; [x] Received 'Fifth message.....'
</pre>

<div></div>

<pre class="lang-bash">
# shell 2
python worker.py
# =&gt; [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C
# =&gt; [x] Received 'Second message..'
# =&gt; [x] Received 'Fourth message....'
</pre>

<p>By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer,
in sequence. On average every consumer will get the same number of
messages. This way of distributing messages is called round-robin. Try
this out with three or more workers.</p>
<h2>Message acknowledgment</h2>
<p>Doing a task can take a few seconds. You may wonder what happens if
one of the consumers starts a long task and dies with it only partly done.
With our current code once RabbitMQ delivers message to the consumer it
immediately marks it for deletion. In this case, if you kill a worker
we will lose the message it was just processing. We'll also lose all
the messages that were dispatched to this particular worker but were not
yet handled.</p>
<p>But we don't want to lose any tasks. If a worker dies, we'd like the
task to be delivered to another worker.</p>
<p>In order to make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports
<a href="../confirms.html">message <em>acknowledgments</em></a>. An ack(nowledgement) is sent back by the
consumer to tell RabbitMQ that a particular message had been received,
processed and that RabbitMQ is free to delete it.</p>
<p>If a consumer dies (its channel is closed, connection is closed, or
TCP connection is lost) without sending an ack, RabbitMQ will
understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will re-queue it.
If there are other consumers online at the same time, it will then quickly redeliver it
to another consumer. That way you can be sure that no message is lost,
even if the workers occasionally die.</p>
<p>A timeout (30 minutes by default) is enforced on consumer delivery acknowledgement.
This helps detect buggy (stuck) consumers that never acknowledge deliveries.
You can increase this timeout as described in
<a href="../consumers.html#acknowledgement-timeout">Delivery Acknowledgement Timeout</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../confirms.html">Manual message acknowledgments</a> are turned on by default. In previous
examples we explicitly turned them off via the <span class="code ">auto_ack=True</span>
flag. It's time to remove this flag and send a proper acknowledgment
from the worker, once we're done with a task.</p>
<pre class="lang-python">
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(" [x] Received %r" % body.decode())
    time.sleep(body.count(b'.') )
    print(" [x] Done")
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)

channel.basic_consume(queue='hello', on_message_callback=callback)
</pre>

<p>Using this code we can be sure that even if you kill a worker using
CTRL+C while it was processing a message, nothing will be lost. Soon
after the worker dies all unacknowledged messages will be redelivered.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement must be sent on the same channel that received the
delivery. Attempts to acknowledge using a different channel will result
in a channel-level protocol exception. See the <a href="../confirms.html">doc guide on confirmations</a>
to learn more.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Forgotten acknowledgment</h4>
<p>It's a common mistake to miss the <span class="code ">basic_ack</span>. It's an easy error,
but the consequences are serious. Messages will be redelivered
when your client quits (which may look like random redelivery), but
RabbitMQ will eat more and more memory as it won't be able to release
any unacked messages.</p>
<p>In order to debug this kind of mistake you can use <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span>
to print the <span class="code ">messages_unacknowledged</span> field:</p>
<p><pre class="lang-bash">
sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
</pre></p>
<p>On Windows, drop the sudo:
<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl.bat list_queues name messages_ready messages_unacknowledged
</pre></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Message durability</h2>
<p>We have learned how to make sure that even if the consumer dies, the
task isn't lost. But our tasks will still be lost if RabbitMQ server
stops.</p>
<p>When RabbitMQ quits or crashes it will forget the queues and messages
unless you tell it not to. Two things are required to make sure that
messages aren't lost: we need to mark both the queue and messages as
durable.</p>
<p>First, we need to make sure that the queue will survive a RabbitMQ node restart.
In order to do so, we need to declare it as <em>durable</em>:</p>
<pre class="lang-python">
channel.queue_declare(queue='hello', durable=True)
</pre>

<p>Although this command is correct by itself, it won't work in our
setup. That's because we've already defined a queue called <span class="code ">hello</span>
which is not durable. RabbitMQ doesn't allow you to redefine an existing queue
with different parameters and will return an error to any program
that tries to do that. But there is a quick workaround - let's declare
a queue with different name, for example <span class="code ">task_queue</span>:</p>
<pre class="lang-python">
channel.queue_declare(queue='task_queue', durable=True)
</pre>

<p>This <span class="code ">queue_declare</span> change needs to be applied to both the producer
and consumer code.</p>
<p>At that point we're sure that the <span class="code ">task_queue</span> queue won't be lost
even if RabbitMQ restarts. Now we need to mark our messages as persistent -
by supplying a <span class="code ">delivery_mode</span> property with the value of <span class="code ">pika.spec.PERSISTENT_DELIVERY_MODE</span></p>
<pre class="lang-python">
channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
                      routing_key="task_queue",
                      body=message,
                      properties=pika.BasicProperties(
                         delivery_mode = pika.spec.PERSISTENT_DELIVERY_MODE
                      ))
</pre>

<blockquote>
<h4>Note on message persistence</h4>
<p>Marking messages as persistent doesn't fully guarantee that a message
won't be lost. Although it tells RabbitMQ to save the message to disk,
there is still a short time window when RabbitMQ has accepted a message and
hasn't saved it yet. Also, RabbitMQ doesn't do <span class="code ">fsync(2)</span> for every
message -- it may be just saved to cache and not really written to the
disk. The persistence guarantees aren't strong, but it's more than enough
for our simple task queue. If you need a stronger guarantee then you can use
<a href="../confirms.html">publisher confirms</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fair dispatch</h2>
<p>You might have noticed that the dispatching still doesn't work exactly
as we want. For example in a situation with two workers, when all
odd messages are heavy and even messages are light, one worker will be
constantly busy and the other one will do hardly any work. Well,
RabbitMQ doesn't know anything about that and will still dispatch
messages evenly.</p>
<p>This happens because RabbitMQ just dispatches a message when the message
enters the queue. It doesn't look at the number of unacknowledged
messages for a consumer. It just blindly dispatches every n-th message
to the n-th consumer.</p>
<div class="diagram">
  <img src="../img/tutorials/prefetch-count.png" height="110" />
  <div class="diagram_source">
    digraph {
      bgcolor=transparent;
      truecolor=true;
      rankdir=LR;
      node [style="filled"];
      //
      P1 [label="P", fillcolor="#00ffff"];
      subgraph cluster_Q1 {
        label="queue_name=hello";
    color=transparent;
        Q1 [label="{||||}", fillcolor="red", shape="record"];
      };
      C1 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      C2 [label=&lt;C&lt;font point-size="7"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&gt;, fillcolor="#33ccff"];
      //
      P1 -&gt; Q1;
      Q1 -&gt; C1 [label="prefetch=1"] ;
      Q1 -&gt; C2 [label="prefetch=1"] ;
    }
  </div>
</div>

<p>In order to defeat that we can use the <span class="code ">Channel#basic_qos</span> channel method with the
<span class="code ">prefetch_count=1</span> setting. This uses the <span class="code ">basic.qos</span> protocol method to tell RabbitMQ
not to give more than one message to a worker at a time. Or, in other words, don't dispatch
a new message to a worker until it has processed and acknowledged the
previous one. Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.</p>
<pre class="lang-python">
channel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=1)
</pre>

<blockquote>
<h4>Note about queue size</h4>
<p>If all the workers are busy, your queue can fill up. You will want to keep an
eye on that, and maybe add more workers, or use <a href="../ttl.html">message TTL</a>.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

print(' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C')


def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(" [x] Received %r" % body.decode())
    time.sleep(body.count(b'.'))
    print(" [x] Done")
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)


channel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=1)
channel.basic_consume(queue='task_queue', on_message_callback=callback)

channel.start_consuming()
</pre>

<p>Using message acknowledgments and <span class="code ">prefetch_count</span> you can set up a
