# Memory and Disk Alarms

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

There are two circumstances under which RabbitMQ will stop
reading from client network sockets, in order to avoid being killed by the
OS (out-of-memory killer). They are:

 * When [memory use](memory-use.html) goes above the configured limit.
 * When [free disk space](/disk-alarms.html) drops below the configured limit.

In both circumstances the server will temporarily <em>block</em>
connections - the server will pause reading from the sockets of
connected clients which publish messages. Connection
heartbeat monitoring will be disabled too. All network
connections will show in <code>rabbitmqctl</code> and the
management plugin as either <code>blocking</code>, meaning they
have not attempted to publish and can thus continue or
<code>blocked</code>, meaning they have published and are now
paused. Compatible clients will be [notified](#client-notifications)
when they are blocked.

Connections that only consume are not blocked by resource alarms; deliveries
to them continue as usual.


## <a id="client-notifications" class="anchor" href="#client-notifications">Client Notifications</a>

Modern client libraries support [connection.blocked notification](/connection-blocked.html)
(a protocol extension), so applications can monitor when they are blocked.


## <a id="effects-on-clusters" class="anchor" href="#effects-on-clusters">Alarms in Clusters</a>

When running RabbitMQ in a cluster, the memory and disk alarms
are cluster-wide; if one node goes over the limit then all nodes
will block connections.

The intent here is to stop producers but let consumers continue
unaffected. However, since the protocol permits producers and consumers
to operate on the same channel, and on different channels of a
single connection, this logic is necessarily imperfect. In
practice that does not pose any problems for most applications
since the throttling is observable merely as a
delay. Nevertheless, other design considerations permitting, it
is advisable to only use individual connections for either
producing or consuming.


## <a id="data-safety" class="anchor" href="#data-safety">Effects on Data Safety</a>

When an alarm is in effect, publishing connections will be blocked by TCP back pressure.
In practice this means that publish operations will eventually time out of fail outright.
Application developers must be prepared to handle such failures and use [publisher confirms](/confirms.html)
to keep track of what messages have been successfully handled and processed by RabbitMQ.


## <a id="file-descriptors" class="anchor" href="#file-descriptors">Running Out of File Descriptors</a>

When the server is close to using all the file descriptors
that the OS has made available to it, it will refuse client
connections. See [Networking guide](/networking.html) to learn more.


## <a id="transient-flow-control" class="anchor" href="#transient-flow-control">Transient Flow Control</a>

When clients attempt to publish faster than the server can
accept their messages, they go into transient [flow control](/flow-control.html).
