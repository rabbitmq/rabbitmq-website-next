## RabbitMQ 3.8.12-beta.1

RabbitMQ `3.8.12-beta.1` is a preview of a maintenance release that contains bug fixes.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 22](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or
[Erlang 23](http://blog.erlang.org/OTP-23-Highlights/).

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `22.3.x`.


## Upgrade and Compatibility Notes

### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade and
compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release series (e.g. `3.7.x`).

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and
[RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

### Upgrading to Erlang 22.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release from `3.7.15` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.

Because older RabbitMQ CLI tools can be incompatible with Erlang 22+ releases,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**.

Alternatively the node can be upgraded to `3.7.18` on Erlang 21.3 first,
then Erlang 22.x or 23.x, then RabbitMQ to the most recent 3.8.x release.

### Getting Help

Any questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users)

## Changes Worth Mentioning

### Prometheus Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * AuthN authentication attempts metrics produced duplicate `TYPE` and `HELP` strings in
   the scraping API endpoint output.

   Some metrics were renamed to avoid duplication. The new names are `auth_attempts_detailed_total`,
   `auth_attempts_detailed_succeeded_total`, and `auth_attempts_detailed_failed_total`.

   This issue is specific to RabbitMQ `3.8.10` and `3.8.11`.
