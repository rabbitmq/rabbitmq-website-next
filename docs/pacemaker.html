    <p class="warning">
      This part documents a technique for achieving
      active-passive high availability with
      RabbitMQ. <a href="ha.html">Mirrored queues</a>
      can be easier to use and do not impose a delay at failover.
    </p>
      <div class="docSection"><a name="introduction" class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>
        <p>There are many forms of high availability, replication and
        resilience in the face of various different types of
        failure. RabbitMQ can be made to work in an active/passive
        setup, such that persistent messages that have been written to
        disk on the active node are able to be recovered by the
        passive node should the active node fail. Non-persistent
        messages will be lost, and the promotion of the passive node
        may take a little while as it reads the messages off disk.
        </p>

        <p>Whilst RabbitMQ also supports <a href="clustering.html">clustering</a>, clustering is intended
        to facilitate scalability, not availability. Thus in a
        cluster, if a node fails, queues which were on the failed node
        are lost. With the high availability setup described in this
        guide, when a node fails, the durable queues and the
        persistent messages within them can be recovered by a
        different node.</p>

        <img src="img/pacemaker.png" />

        <p>Clustering can be combined with high availability to create
        a cluster that can scale beyond a single node and
        simultaneously preserve persistent messages and durable
        resources in the event of node failure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="requirements" class="anchor" id="requirements"></a>
	<h2 class="docHeading"><a class="anchor" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

        <p>This guide assumes that you're going to use the <a href="http://www.clusterlabs.org/">Pacemaker</a> HA stack to
        do the resource management and monitoring. This guide will
        also make use of <a href="http://www.drbd.org/">DRBD</a> to
        provide a shared storage area in which the active node will
        write messages. If you have a NAS or SAN or some other means
        of providing reliable shared storage to both nodes, then you
        can use that instead of DRBD. If you are going to use DRBD,
        note that the DRBD OCF script which we use later on only
        appeared in DRBD version 8.3.2.</p>

        <p>This guide uses CoroSync (which is a cut-down version of
        OpenAIS) in preference to Heartbeat as the messaging layer
        underneath Pacemaker. However, we also have Heartbeat
        installed so as to be able to access Heartbeat's OCF
        scripts. You should find that the instructions here work
        equally well regardless of whether you use CoroSync, Heartbeat
        or OpenAIS.</p>

        <p>Note that CoroSync relies on multicast in order to do
        resource discovery. In some environments (e.g. EC2), multicast
        is not available. Heartbeat, which can do resource discovery
        using unicast, is the recommended solution if multicast is not
        available.</p>

        <p>This guide does not tell you how to install Pacemaker,
        Heartbeat, OpenAIS, CoroSync or DRBD - there are already
        several good guides available for these tasks:</p>

        <p><ul class="plain">
          <li><a href="http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Install">Pacemaker
          install guide</a></li>
	  <li>General <a href="http://www.clusterlabs.org/wiki/Documentation">Pacemaker
	  documentation</a>: In particular, see the <i>Clusters from
	  scratch</i> guides</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.drbd.org/users-guide/">DRBD
          users guide</a></li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>As of August 2010, Debian <i>testing</i> and Ubuntu
        <i>lucid</i> both contain sufficiently up-to-date versions of
        Heartbeat, CoroSync and Pacemaker that it should not be
        necessary to compile from source.</p>

        <p>If you're compiling Pacemaker et al from source, be aware
        that the various autoconf configure scripts don't seem to test
        thoroughly enough for various libraries, the result of which
        is that compilation may eventually fail due to missing
        libraries, even though the configure script passes. Under
        Debian Sid, we have had to install the following extra
        packages, though obviously your mileage will vary with
        different distributions:
        <span class="code ">autoconf libtool pkg-config
        libglib2.0-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev uuid-dev uuid-runtime
        libnss3-dev groff libxslt1.1 libxslt1-dev libesmtp5 libesmtp-dev libssl-dev ssmping xsltproc</span>. Be aware that
        we have found that if the build does fail, merely installing
        the necessary libraries was not enough to make the build then
        pass - we have had to go back and re-run the autotools and
        configure steps before it would find the new libraries and
        compile correctly.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="assumption" class="anchor" id="assumption"></a>
	<h2 class="docHeading"><a class="anchor" href="#assumption">Assumptions</a></h2>

        <p>By this point, we assume that you have installed Pacemaker
        and, if you're going to use it, DRBD, on two different
        machines, which can see each other. You should have configured
        DRBD and thus be able to set one node the primary and the
        other the secondary for the DRBD resource. The initial sync
        between the two nodes has already been done. Our DRBD resource
        <span class="code ">drbd1</span> configuration looks like:</p>

<pre class="lang-plaintext">
global {
  usage-count no;
}

resource drbd1 {
  device    /dev/drbd1;
  disk      /dev/vdb;
  meta-disk internal;
  protocol  C;
  on ha-node-1 {
    address   192.168.100.21:7789;
  }
  on ha-node-2 {
    address   192.168.100.22:7789;
  }
}
</pre>

        <p>We assume that if you bring up the DRBD device, you have
        already put a file-system on it and can mount and unmount
        it. <span class="code ">crm configure show</span> should show nothing
        configured:</p>

<pre class="lang-plaintext">
ha-node-2:~# crm configure show

        resource-stickiness="100"
</pre>
        <p>Note that here we have already set stickiness to 100,
        disabled STONITH, and told Pacemaker not to worry about not
        having quorum (see the section <i>Create an Active/Passive
        cluster</i> in the <i>Clusters from scratch</i> guides
        referenced above). In reality, you probably do want STONITH
        devices, and you'll want a cluster of at least 3 nodes, so
        that quorum can be maintained in the event of node failure,
        and ring-fencing can occur.</p>

	<h2 class="docHeading"><a class="anchor" href="#drbd_pacemaker">DRBD in Pacemaker</a></h2>

        <p>If you are planning on using DRBD to provide shared
        storage, you need to get Pacemaker to manage this. The
        instructions here are adapted for our setup but are pretty
        much the same as from the <i>Clusters from scratch</i> guides
        and from the <a href="http://www.drbd.org/users-guide/ch-pacemaker.html">DRBD
        Pacemaker documentation</a>. DRBD only allows one node at a
        time access to the shared device, so there is never any danger
        of multiple nodes writing over the same data. If you're using
        some other means to provide shared storage, you may wish to
        use Pacemaker to ensure only one node has the shared storage
        area mounted at any one time.</p>

        <p>The first <span class="code ">configure</span> command here creates a
        resource <i>drbd</i>. That is then incorporated into a
        resource called <i>drbd_ms</i> in the second
        <span class="code ">configure</span>. We then create a <i>drbd_fs</i>
        resource which knows how to mount the DRBD device. We can only
        mount the DRBD resource on the node which is the master, so we
        then create a colocation directive <i>fs_on_drbd</i> which
        states that the <i>drbd_fs</i> and <i>drbd_ms:Master</i>
        resources must be on the same node. Finally, we know that we
        can only mount the file-system once the node has successfully
        become the master node for the DRBD device. Similarly, we must
        un-mount the DRBD device before degrading a node to the
        secondary for the DRBD device. Both of these are achieved by
        creating the order directive which says to promote the
        <i>drbd_ms</i> resource before starting the <i>drbd_fs</i>
        resource. Note that after committing the shadow CIB into the
        live CIB and switching back to the live CIB, we delete the old
        shadow CIB - this is purely a housekeeping exercise and is not
        essential.</p>

        <p>If you're not using DRBD, you will just want to configure a
        single primitive <span class="code ">ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem</span> which
        can mount the shared storage.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="docSection"><a name="simple_rabbit" class="anchor" id="simple_rabbit"></a>
	<h2 class="docHeading"><a class="anchor" href="#simple_rabbit">Simple HA Rabbit</a></h2>

        <p>The main trick to HA Rabbit is to ensure that when the
        passive node becomes the active node, it must have the same
        node-name as the failed node. It must also have read and write
        access to the files in the shared storage, and if it's going
        to also be part of a cluster then it must also have the same
        Erlang cookie.</p>

        <p>Start by installing the RabbitMQ server on both nodes. The
        server runs as the user <span class="code ">rabbitmq</span> which is a
        member of the group <span class="code ">rabbitmq</span>. You must ensure
        that this user and group have the same UIDs and GIDs on both
        nodes. You can probably save yourself some time by explicitly
        creating the <span class="code ">rabbitmq</span> user and group with the
        same UID and GID on all nodes before installing the RabbitMQ
        server at all. If necessary, edit <span class="code ">/etc/passwd</span> and
        <span class="code ">/etc/group</span> on both nodes, and then reinstall the
        RabbitMQ server to ensure all necessary files are owned by the
        correct user and group. Also make sure the
        <span class="code ">rabbitmq</span> user has permission to write and read to
        the shared storage mount point (<span class="code ">/media/drbd1</span> in
        our example above). Although not strictly necessary at this
        stage, next ensure that all the nodes share the same Erlang
        cookie. The <span class="code ">rabbitmq</span> home directory is normally
        <span class="code ">/var/lib/rabbitmq</span>, so:</p>

<pre class="lang-plaintext">
ha-node-2:~# scp /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie ha-node-1:/var/lib/rabbitmq/

ha-node-1:~# chown rabbitmq: /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
ha-node-1:~# chmod 400 /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
</pre>

        <p>We also need to make sure that when the nodes boot, they
        don't start Rabbit. Thus edit the init script (usually at
        <span class="code ">/etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server</span>) and just insert an
        <span class="code ">exit 0</span> after the comments at the top (the more
        <i>correct</i> solution is to use something like
        <span class="code ">update-rc.d rabbitmq-server disable S 2 3 4 5</span>,
        depending on your platform). Now create a resource in
        Pacemaker for Rabbit:</p>

<pre class="lang-plaintext">

        <p>We create a resource called <i>bunny</i> which is our
        RabbitMQ instance. We configure it to place its database files
        (and message store) on our DRBD-backed mount point. We then
        need to colocate the <i>bunny</i> resource with the
        <i>drbd_fs</i> resource, and we also need to make sure that
        the file-system is mounted before we start the <i>bunny</i>
        resource (and similarly, the <i>bunny</i> resource is stopped
        before we un-mount the file-system). The status of the
        resources can be seen by running <span class="code ">crm status</span> on
        any active node:</p>

     Masters: [ ha-node-1 ]
     Slaves: [ ha-node-2 ]
 drbd_fs        (ocf::heartbeat:Filesystem):    Started ha-node-1
</pre>

        <p>Thus we can see that the <i>bunny</i> and <i>drbd_fs</i>
        resources are running only on <span class="code ">ha-node-1</span> and that
        the <i>drbd_ms</i> resource has its master as
        <span class="code ">ha-node-1</span> and its mirror as
        <span class="code ">ha-node-2</span>. The output of <span class="code ">mount</span>
        should show that <span class="code ">/media/drbd1</span> is mounted only on
        <span class="code ">ha-node-1</span>, and a
        <span class="code ">ps ax | grep [r]abbit</span> should show that RabbitMQ is running only on
        <span class="code ">ha-node-1</span>.</p>

        <p>If you stop <span class="code ">ha-node-1</span> (turn it off, or just
        stop Heartbeat or CoroSync), you should find all the services
        migrate to the other node. If you create some durable
        resources (e.g. durable queues or exchanges), you should find
        that these survive the transition to the other node. It's a
        good idea to play with stopping and starting the nodes at this
        point to build confidence that it really is doing the right
        thing. Status commands (
        <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl -n rabbit@localhost status</span> and
        <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl -n rabbit@localhost cluster_status</span>) will allow you to see the status of
        RabbitMQ server from whichever node it is currently running
        on.</p>

        <p>By default, the <span class="code ">ocf:rabbitmq:rabbitmq-server</span>
        script sets the node-name to <span class="code ">rabbit@localhost</span> on
        all nodes. This is the simplest solution as it should always
        be possible to resolve <span class="code ">localhost</span>, but it does
        mean that you can't join a cluster. We'll correct that later
        on.</p>

        <p>To stop the <i>bunny</i> resource you just need to run
        <span class="code ">crm resource bunny stop</span>, and likewise to start
        it, <span class="code ">crm resource bunny start</span>. Note that you'll
        need to do this manually before upgrading Rabbit as if you're
        using a binary package then you'll have likely disabled the
        <span class="code ">rabbitmq-server</span> init script, which will mean the
        package manager will fail to safely stop RabbitMQ prior to
        upgrading its source. Unless the upgrade is changing the
        database schema or the format of the persisted data, you
        should be able to upgrade RabbitMQ on the passive node, then
        migrate RabbitMQ to the passive node (
        <span class="code ">crm resource migrate bunny</span>) and upgrade what was the active
        node.</p>

	<h2 class="docHeading"><a class="anchor" href="#with_ip">Getting an IP address to move with Rabbit</a></h2>

        <p>You may wish your highly-available Rabbit to always be
        accessible on the same IP address. There are a number of ways
        to achieve this, for example, you could use a TCP load
        balancer. Here, we demonstrate getting Pacemaker to migrate an
        IP address with Rabbit. Note that if you're happy to build
        into your clients the various IPs on which Rabbit may be
        available, then you may not need this step at all.</p>

        <p>In testing, we have found that the IP migration done by
        Pacemaker frequently hangs if the IP address being migrated is
        on the same network as another IP interface on the same
        node. In the example here, the two nodes have IP addresses of
        192.168.100.21 and 192.168.100.22 (both on a /24). We shall
        therefore choose that the IP on which Rabbit will always be
        available is 192.168.50.1 (i.e. a different network). This
        seems to make the migration of the IP address more
        reliable.</p>

        <p>This should all be looking rather familiar by now. We

        and we make sure that the <i>bunny</i> resource is started
        after, and stopped before, the <i>ip</i> resource. By default,
        the RabbitMQ server will listen on all network interfaces, so
        we are done now, but we can explicitly tell it to listen on

        <span class="code ">crm</span>, calling <span class="code ">configure edit bunny</span>
        and then in the editor that will appear, adding to the
        <i>params</i> <span class="code ">ip="192.168.50.1"</span>. The RabbitMQ
        server should then immediately be restarted, as Pacemaker
        detects that its configuration has changed. You should now
        find that when a node fails, all the resources get transferred
        over to the spare node, and Rabbit will start up on the same
        IP address. Thus clients can be completely oblivious as to
        which node is the active node, and which is the passive
        node. You could also indicate to Rabbit the IP address to use
        by editing the <a href="configure.html#configuration-file">RabbitMQ
        configuration file</a> and providing an entry for
        <span class="code ">tcp_listeners</span>. However, that would then spread
        the configuration across multiple systems, and would require
        you to both synchronise the configuration across all the HA
        nodes, and to restart the <i>bunny</i> resource.</p>

        <p>Finally, we wish to be able to construct a cluster of
        Rabbits which can survive node failure and still remain a
        cluster. Our plan is to have a cluster of 2 RabbitMQ servers,
        spread across 3 nodes, one of which is the passive node for
        both of the others. Thus in the event of failure of a single
        node, either the passive node dies, or one of the active nodes
        die, causing a migration onto the shared passive node.</p>

        <img src="img/pacemaker-cluster.png" />

        <p>Sadly, we are limited by DRBD here: in an ideal world, we
        would like that for each RabbitMQ service, any of the three
        nodes could be the active, and any of the three nodes could be
        the secondary. That would require DRBD to be able to have one
        primary and multiple secondary nodes, and to be able to
        promote any of the secondaries to primaries in the event of
        failure and then add back in any failed node as a secondary,
        which it can't do in general. However, if you're using a NAS
        or SAN, then you likely will be able to achieve this extra
        flexibility.</p>

        <p>So far, we have two nodes: <span class="code ">ha-node-1</span> and
        <span class="code ">ha-node-2</span> which are fully configured with DRBD,
        RabbitMQ, mobile IPs and filesystems. We now repeat all the
        above instructions again, but this time with a new machine
        <span class="code ">ha-node-3</span> and the existing
        <span class="code ">ha-node-2</span>. The idea is that
        <span class="code ">ha-node-1</span> and <span class="code ">ha-node-3</span> will be the
        active nodes, and <span class="code ">ha-node-2</span> will form the
        passive. Thus when adding all the additional resources, you'll
        need to make sure all the resource names are different, and
        obviously you'll need to take into account the change in host
        name, a different mount point, DRBD resource name, and a
        different mobile IP address (which I shall assume to be
        192.168.50.2).</p>

        <p>Rabbit nodes within a cluster need to be able to resolve
        each others' host-name. Currently we have that the node-name
        is set to <span class="code ">rabbit@localhost</span> which must be changed
        as the other nodes in the cluster would get the wrong idea if
        we asked them to resolve <i>localhost</i>. We can't use the IP
        address raw (i.e. we can't have the node-name as
        <span class="code ">rabbit@192.168.50.1</span>) without switching to
        long-names, which is more work, so instead our plan is to give
        a host-name of rabbit-ha-1 to 192.168.50.1, rabbit-ha-2 to
        192.168.50.2 and then set the node-names to
        <span class="code ">rabbit@rabbit-ha-1</span> and
        <span class="code ">rabbit@rabbit-ha-2</span>. There are a number of ways to
        do this - either configure this in your DNS server, or edit
        enough <span class="code ">/etc/hosts</span> files to ensure that all the HA
        nodes can resolve <i>rabbit-ha-1</i> and
        <i>rabbit-ha-2</i>.</p>

        <p>Having done that, you should now be able to issue (assuming
        the second RabbitMQ server resource is called
        <i>bunny2</i>):</p>

<pre class="lang-plaintext">
ha-node-2:~# crm_resource --resource bunny --set-parameter nodename --parameter-value "rabbit@rabbit-ha-1"
ha-node-2:~# crm_resource --resource bunny2 --set-parameter nodename --parameter-value "rabbit@rabbit-ha-2"
ha-node-2:~#
</pre>

        <p>The <i>bunny</i> and <i>bunny2</i> resources should
        instantly restart, reflecting the changes in node-names. As
        per the <a href="clustering.html">clustering guide</a>, we
        have already ensured that we have the same Erlang cookie on
        all of the HA nodes, and we issue the following commands to
        form the cluster:</p>

<pre class="lang-plaintext">
ha-node-3:~# rabbitmqctl stop_app
ha-node-3:~# rabbitmqctl reset
ha-node-3:~# rabbitmqctl cluster rabbit@rabbit-ha-1 rabbit@rabbit-ha-2
ha-node-3:~# rabbitmqctl start_app
ha-node-3:~# rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node 'rabbit@rabbit-ha-2' ...
[{nodes,[{disc,['rabbit@rabbit-ha-1','rabbit@rabbit-ha-2']}]},
 {running_nodes,['rabbit@rabbit-ha-1','rabbit@rabbit-ha-2']}]
...done.
ha-node-3:~#
</pre>

        <p>And that's it - you should find that if you kill either of
        the HA nodes which are running Rabbit then the resources
        should transfer over to the passive node, Rabbit will start
        up, and will successfully reconnect back into the cluster.</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Another option to configure clusters "on the fly" is
          <a href="http://www.linux-ha.org/wiki/Resource_agents">Pacemaker resource agents</a>.
          There are several OCF RA agents exist upstream. More details in
          <a href="https://github.com/lemenkov/pmk-rmq.md/blob/master/pmk-rmq.md">this comparison</a>.
          The OCF scripts for the cluster resource agents are located at
          <span class="code ">/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/rabbitmq/</span>. The first one
          <span class="code ">/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server</span>
          is a generic init-like script and provides no clustering.
          The second one <span class="code ">/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-ha</span>
          (referenced as "RabbitMQ HA" in the comparison spreadsheet)
          provides an active-active disposable cluster configuration with a dynamic membership
          of nodes. Note that only disc nodes are currently supported by the OCF agent.
          There is also an example <i>policy file</i>
          <span class="code ">/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/rabbitmq/set_rabbitmq_policy.sh.example</span>
          to enforce required modes to queues runtime.
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
          A disposable cluster does not guarantee data persistence for some failure modes!
          It may end up wiping the mnesia database, which is all data, of all of the
          cluster nodes. Make sure to make
          <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/persistence-conf.html">persistent configs</a>
          and configure export/import for definitions as well. See the
          <i>definitions_dump_file</i> and <i>policy_file</i> OCF RA configuration parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start using this OCF agent, first create a
          <a href="http://clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/s-resource-multistate.html">multi-state resource</a>
          in your running Pacemaker cluster of 3 or more nodes. Note, that a Pacemaker &gt;= 1.1.14
          is recommended. With either the <span class="code ">pcs</span>
          or <span class="code ">crm</span> tools, the example commands may look like:

        <p>
          After that, your cluster has to be assembled by the OCF agent and ready for operations.
          When assembled, one and only one resource instance must run as a resource primary (master), and others as secondaries.
          Note that these are the multi-state resource's Master/Slave and has nothing to the RabbitMQ cluster,
          which is active-active.

  <h2 class="docHeading"><a class="anchor" href="#params">Pacemaker resource agent actions flow charts</a></h2>

        <p>
          The OCF resource agent clustering logic is based on a Pacemaker actions.
          These are monitor, start, stop, promote, demote and corresponding
          pre and post notifications being sent cluster-wide.
          The flow charts of events for the main actions are depicted below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promoting a new master resource:
        </p>

        <img src="img/Rabbitmq_clustering_pacemaker_promote.png" />
        <p>
          Note that the <i>policy_file</i>, if configured, will be called on each promote action.
          This script may be used to specify ha-mode for mirrored queues, configure expiration
          policy and so on. Also note that when a node is promoted, the rest of the cluster
          members will remain running as is, unless any issues discovered later (lazy joining).
        </p>
        <p>
          Demoting a master resource:
        </p>
        <img src="img/Rabbitmq_clustering_pacemaker_demote.png" />
        <p>
          Nothing is done on demote, the script only removes rabbit-master attribute to remember
          that the current node is no longer master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting a resource:
        </p>
        <img src="img/Rabbitmq_clustering_pacemaker_start.png" />
        <p>
          Note that if several nodes started, few post-start notify events may be
          missed by a Pacemaker. In order to join these nodes missed post-start events,
          the running nodes are being checked as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stopping the resource:
        </p>
        <img src="img/Rabbitmq_clustering_pacemaker_stop.png" />
        <p>
          Note that the notify post-stop will not be called, if any corosync node running the
          pacemaker resource agent for RabbitMQ had failed. In order to handle it, an
          external fencing action (a manual or automatic) is required. This action should kick
          the failed node from the RabbitMQ cluster as well. And it should re-join the node back
          to both the corosync and RabbitMQ clusters once it is restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Handling split brain:
        </p>
        <img src="img/Rabbitmq_clustering_pacemaker_split_brain.png" />
        <p>
          Before checking if other nodes are clustered with the master, the master first checks
          its own health. Only if its health is ok, orders to restart could be given to the other
          nodes. That way we always keep at least one node (master) alive.
        </p>
	<h2 class="docHeading"><a class="anchor" href="#params">Configuration Parameters</a></h2>

          The configuration parameters that can be provided in

          <span class="code ">RABBITMQ_*</span> environment variables that can be used

          And there are even more configuration parameters for the

          can be as well listed with either the <span class="code ">pcs</span> tool:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-bash">
$ <i>pcs resource describe ocf:rabbitmq:rabbitmq-server-ha</i>
        </pre>
        <p>
          or by the direct execution of the resource agent:

        <pre class="lang-plaintext">
$i <i>OCF_ROOT=/usr/lib/ocf /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server-ha meta-data</i>
        </pre>
        <p>We only briefly describe some of them here. A few, that help to
          configure persistence and backup/restore existing definitions, was
          already mentioned above: <i>definitions_dump_file</i> and
          <i>policy_file</i>. Another useful parameter is <i>max_rabbitmqctl_timeouts</i>.
          When set with a non-zero value (default is 3), it allows to detect the
          <i>rabbitmqctl</i> consequent timeouts and mitigate by restarting
          affected rabbit nodes, if the RabbitMQ control plane turned
          unresponsive more times than it is allowed by the parameter.
          Note, for a Pacemaker version 1.1.13 or lower, it does nothing.
          Setting the parameter to zero will allow it to work for such cases as
          well, although rendering it to "tolerate nothing" and restart a node
          each time the CP becomes unresponsive.
