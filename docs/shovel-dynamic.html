</h1>


<h2><a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This guide focuses on dynamically configured shovels. It assumes
familiarity with the key concepts behind the <a href="shovel.html">Shovel plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike with static shovels, dynamic shovels are configured using <a href="./parameters.html">runtime parameters</a>.
They can be started and stopped at any time, including programmatically. Dynamic shovels
can be used for both transient (one-off) and permanently running workloads.</p>
<p>Information about dynamic shovels is stored in RabbitMQ's schema database,
along with users, permissions, queues, etc. They therefore can be
exported together with other <a href="./definitions.html">schema definitions</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>Parameters can be defined using <a href="./cli.html"><span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span></a>, through the
<a href="./management.html">management HTTP API</a>, or (with the <span class="code ">rabbitmq_shovel_management</span> plugin <a href="./plugins.html">enabled</a>) through
the management UI's administrative section.</p>
<p>A shovel is declared with a definition body, which is a JSON object. Some keys are mandatory, others are optional.
They control connection parameters, protocol used, message transfer source and destination,
<a href="./confirms.html">data safety</a> protocol features, and more.</p>
<p>Every shovel belongs to a virtual host. Note that a Shovel can consume from and publish
to not only a different virtual host but an entirely different cluster, so
virtual host selection primarily acts as a way of organising shovels and access to them,
much like with the rest of <a href="./access-control.html">permission in RabbitMQ</a>.</p>
<p>Every shovel is also named. The name is used to identify shovels when <a href="#status">inspecting their status</a>,
<a href="#deleting">deleting them</a> or <a href="#restarting">restarting them</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="declaring" class="anchor" href="#declaring">Declaring a Dynamic Shovel</a></h2>
<p>In this example we will set up a dynamic shovel that will move messages from the queue <span class="code ">"source-queue"</span> in the
local RabbitMQ cluster to the queue <span class="code ">"target-queue"</span> on a remote RabbitMQ node, using AMQP 0-9-1.</p>
<h3>Using CLI Tools</h3>
<p>A shovel is declared using the <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl set_parameter</span> command with component name <span class="code ">shovel</span>, a shovel
name and a definition body which is a JSON document:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
# my-shovel here is the name of the shovel
rabbitmqctl set_parameter shovel my-shovel \
  '{"src-protocol": "amqp091", "src-uri": "amqp://", "src-queue": "source-queue", "dest-protocol": "amqp091", "dest-uri": "amqp://remote-server", "dest-queue": "target-queue"}'
</pre>

<p>On Windows <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl</span> is named <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl.bat</span> and command line value escaping will be
different:</p>
<pre class="lang-powershell">
rabbitmqctl.bat set_parameter shovel my-shovel ^
  "{""src-protocol"": ""amqp091"", ""src-uri"":""amqp://localhost"", ""src-queue"": ""source-queue"", ^
   ""dest-protocol"": ""amqp091"", ""dest-uri"": ""amqp://remote.rabbitmq.local"", ^
   ""dest-queue"": ""target-queue""}"
</pre>

<p>The body in this example includes a few keys:</p>
<table>
  <caption>Essential Dynamic Shovel Definition Settings</caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Key</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>src-uri</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Source connection URI. Mandatory. See
          the <a href="./uri-spec.html">AMQP URI reference</a> for
          information on how RabbitMQ treats AMQP URIs in general,
          and the <a href="./uri-query-parameters.html">query parameter reference</a> for additional
          query parameters that are recognised by the Shovel and Federation plugins
          (such as TLS settings).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this field can either be a string, or a list of
          strings. If more than one string is provided, the shovel will
          randomly pick <strong>one</strong> URI from the list until
          one of the endpoints succeeds.
        </p>
        </td>

      <td>
        Protocol to use when connecting to the source.
        Either <span class="code ">amqp091</span> or <span class="code ">amqp10</span>. If omitted it will default to <span class="code ">amqp091</span>.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There are other Shovel definition keys that will be covered later in this guide.</p>
<h3>Using HTTP API</h3>
<p>To declare a shovel using the HTTP API, make sure that the <a href="./management.html">management</a> plugin
is enabled, then use the following endpoint:</p>
<pre class="lang-ini">
PUT /api/parameters/shovel/{vhost}/{name}
</pre>

<p>where <span class="code ">{vhost}</span> is the virtual host in which the Shovel should be started and <span class="code ">{name}</span>
is the name of the new shovel. The endpoint requires that the user that invokes it
has <span class="code ">policymaker</span> privileges (tag).</p>
<p>The request body is a JSON document similar in structure to that described earlier in this guide:</p>
<pre class="lang-ini">
{
  "value": {
    "src-protocol": "amqp091",
    "src-uri":  "amqp://localhost",
    "src-queue":  "source-queue",
    "dest-protocol": "amqp091",
    "dest-uri": "amqp://remote.rabbitmq.local",
    "dest-queue": "destination-queue"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Below is an example that uses <span class="code ">curl</span> to declare a shovel on a local node using
<a href="./access-control.html#default-state">default user credentials</a>. The shovel will
transfer messages between two queues, <span class="code ">"source-queue"</span> and <span class="code ">"destination-queue"</span>, in the default virtual host.</p>
<p>Note that this exact command would fail if invoked against
a remote node. Please <a href="./access-control.html">add a new user</a> tagged as <span class="code ">policymaker</span>
for your own experiments.</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
curl -v -u guest:guest -X PUT http://localhost:15672/api/parameters/shovel/%2f/my-shovel \
                       -H "content-type: application/json" \
                       -d @- &lt;&lt;EOF
{
  "value": {
    "src-protocol": "amqp091",
    "src-uri": "amqp://localhost",
    "src-queue": "source-queue",
    "dest-protocol": "amqp091",
    "dest-uri": "amqp://localhost",
    "dest-queue": "destination-queue"
  }
}
EOF
</pre>

<h3>Using Management UI</h3>
<p>To declare a shovel using the management UI, first make sure that the <a href="./management.html">management</a> plugin
is enabled.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <span class="code ">Admin</span> &gt; <span class="code ">Shovel Management</span> &gt; <span class="code ">Add a new shovel</span></li>
<li>Fill out the form with shovel parameters covered earlier in this guide</li>
<li>Click Add shovel</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="status" class="anchor" href="#status">Inspecting Status of Dynamic Shovels</a></h2>
<h3>Using CLI Tools</h3>
<p>Use <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl shovel_status</span> to inspect dynamic shovels in a cluster. The <span class="code ">rabbitmq_shovel</span>
plugin must be enabled on the host where this command is executed.</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl shovel_status --formatter=pretty_table
</pre>

<p>The output can be formatted as JSON and redirected to a tool such as <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/"><span class="code ">jq</span></a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl shovel_status --formatter=json | jq
</pre>

<h3>Using HTTP API</h3>
<p><span class="code ">GET /api/shovels</span> is an endpoint that can be used to list dynamic
shovels in a cluster. The endpoint is provided by the <span class="code ">rabbitmq_shovel_management</span> plugin
which must be enabled on the target node.</p>
<pre class="lang-ini">
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X GET http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/
</pre>

<p>To inspect shovels in a specific virtual host, use <span class="code ">GET /api/shovels/{vhost}</span>
<span class="code ">{vhost}</span> is the virtual host name. The value must be percent-encoded.</p>
<pre class="lang-ini">
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X GET http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/%2f
</pre>

<p>To inspect status of a specific shovels, use <span class="code ">GET /api/shovels/vhost/{vhost}/{name}</span>
<span class="code ">{vhost}</span> is the virtual host in which the Shovel is running and <span class="code ">{name}</span>
is the name of the shovel.  Both values must be percent-encoded.</p>
<pre class="lang-ini">
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X GET http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/vhost/%2f/my-shovel
</pre>

<h3>Using Management UI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <span class="code ">Admin</span> &gt; <span class="code ">Shovel Status</span></li>
<li>Locate the shovel of interest in the table</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="restarting" class="anchor" href="#restarting">Restarting a Shovel</a></h2>
<p>A dynamic Shovel can be restarted. Restarting a shovel briefly interrupts its operations
and makes it reconnect to both source and destination. When an appropriate <a href="./confirms.html">acknowledgement mode</a> is
used by a shovel, the interruption is safe: any unacknowledged or unconfirmed ("in flight") messages
consumed from the source or published to the destination will be automatically requeued
when the shovel is stopped, and consumed again after the restart.</p>
<h3>Using CLI Tools</h3>
<p>Use <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl restart_shovel</span> to restart a shovel using its name. The <span class="code ">rabbitmq_shovel</span>
plugin must be enabled on the host where this command is executed.</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl restart_shovel "my-shovel"
</pre>

<h3>Using HTTP API</h3>
<p><span class="code ">DELETE /api/shovels/vhost/{vhost}/{name}/restart</span> is an endpoint that restarts
a dynamic shovel. The endpoint is provided by the <span class="code ">rabbitmq_shovel_management</span> plugin
which must be enabled on the target node.</p>
<p><span class="code ">{vhost}</span> is the virtual host in which the Shovel is running and <span class="code ">{name}</span>
is the name of the shovel to be restarted.  Both values must be percent-encoded.</p>
<pre class="lang-ini">
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
 curl -v -u guest:guest -X DELETE http://localhost:15672/api/shovels/vhost/%2f/my-shovel/restart
</pre>

<h3>Using Management UI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <span class="code ">Admin</span> &gt; <span class="code ">Shovel Status</span></li>
<li>Locate the shovel of interest in the table</li>
<li>Click Restart and wait for the next UI refresh</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="deleting" class="anchor" href="#deleting">Deleting a Shovel</a></h2>
<h3>Using CLI Tools</h3>
<p>To delete a Shovel using CLI tools, use <span class="code ">rabbitmqctl clear_parameter</span> and pass <span class="code ">shovel</span> for
component name and the name of the shovel that should be deleted:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
rabbitmqctl clear_parameter shovel "my-shovel"
</pre>

<h3>Using HTTP API</h3>
<p><span class="code ">DELETE /api/parameters/shovel/{vhost}/{name}</span> is the endpoint that can be used
to delete a shovel.</p>
<p><span class="code ">{vhost}</span> is the virtual host in which the Shovel is running and <span class="code ">{name}</span>
is the name of the shovel to be deleted. Both values must be percent-encoded.</p>
<pre class="lang-bash">
# Note: this user's access is limited to localhost!
curl -v -u guest:guest -X DELETE http://localhost:15672/api/parameters/shovel/%2f/my-shovel
