<ol class="plain">
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>PURPOSE.</strong> VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) owns a number of
      international trademarks and logos that identify the RabbitMQ community
      and individual RabbitMQ projects (“RabbitMQ Marks”). These trademarks
      include:
    </p>
    <ol class="alpha">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Word: RABBITMQ</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Logos:</strong>
        </p>
        <img src="/img/rabbitmq_logo_strap.png" />
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This policy outlines VMware’s policy and guidelines about the use of
      the RabbitMQ trademarks by members of the RabbitMQ development and
      user community.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        WHY HAVE TRADEMARK GUIDELINES?
      </strong> The RabbitMQ Marks are a symbol of the
      quality and community support associated with the RabbitMQ open
      source software. Trademarks protect not only those using the marks,
      but the entire community as well. Our community members need to know
      that they can rely on the quality and capabilities represented by the
      brand. We also want to provide a level playing field. No one should
      use the RabbitMQ marks in ways that mislead or take advantage of the
      community, or make unfair use of the trademarks. Also, use of the
      RabbitMQ Marks should not be in a disparaging manner because we
      prefer that our marks not be used to be rude about the RabbitMQ open
      source project or its members.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        OPEN SOURCE LICENSE VS. TRADEMARKS.
      </strong> The Apache 2.0 license gives you
      the right to use, copy, distribute and modify the RabbitMQ software.
      However, open source licenses like the Apache 2.0 license do not
      address trademarks. RabbitMQ Marks need to be used in a way
      consistent with trademark law, and that is why we have prepared this
      policy – to help you understand what branding is allowed or required
      when using our software under the Apache license.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        PROPER USE OF THE RabbitMQ MARKS.
      </strong> We want to encourage a robust
      community for the RabbitMQ open source project. Therefore, you may do
      any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that does not
      devalue, dilute, or disparage the RabbitMQ brand. In other words,
      when you do these things, you should behave responsibly and
      reasonably in the interest of the community, but you do not need a
      trademark license from us to do them.
    </p>
    <ol class="alpha">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Nominative Use.
          </strong> You may engage in “nominative use” of the
          RabbitMQ name, but this does not allow you to use the logo.
          Nominative use is sometimes called “fair use” of a trademark, and
          does not require a trademark license from us.  Here are examples:
        </p>
        <ol class="roman">
          <li>
            <p>
              You may use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection with development
              of tools, add-ons, or utilities that are compatible with
              bit-for-bit identical copies of official RabbitMQ software.
              For example:  For example, if you are developing a Foobar
              tool for RabbitMQ, acceptable project titles would be “Foobar
              for RabbitMQ".
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You may use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection with your
              noncommercial redistribution of (1) bit-for-bit identical
              copies of official RabbitMQ software, and (2) unmodified
              copies of official RabbitMQ source packages.  For example, if
              your Foobar product included a full redistribution of
              official RabbitMQ Software or source code packages:
              "RabbitMQ-powered Foobar Product". We strongly discourage,
              and likely would consider it a trademark problem, to use a
              name such as “RabbitMQ Foobar.”
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you offer maintenance, support, or hosting services for
              RabbitMQ software, you may accurately state that in your
              marketing materials or portfolio, without using the RabbitMQ
              logo.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You may modify the RabbitMQ software and state that your
              modified software is “based on the RabbitMQ software” or a
              similar accurate statement, without using the RabbitMQ logo.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You may engage in community advocacy. The RabbitMQ software
              is developed by and for its community. We will allow the use
              of the word trademark in this context, provided:
            </p>
            <ol class="plain">
              <li>
                <p>
                  The trademark is used in a manner consistent with this
                  policy
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  There is no commercial purpose behind the use
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  There is no suggestion that your project is approved,
                  sponsored, or affiliated with VMware.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  User or Development Groups. You may create RabbitMQ user
                  or development groups, and publicize meetings or
                  discussions for those groups.  Please consider joining
                  our official group.

            Attribution.
          </strong> Identify the trademarks as trademarks of VMware, as

        <p>
          <strong>
            Redistribution of Binaries.
          </strong> If you redistribute binaries that you have downloaded
          from the RabbitMQ repository, you should retain the logos and
          name of the product.  However, if you make any changes to the
          binaries (other than configuration or installation changes that
          do not involve changes to the source code), or if you re-build
          binaries from our source code, you should not use our logos.  Our
          logos represent our quality control, so they should be retained
          where the product has been built by us, but not otherwise.  Our
          source code does not include logo image files, to remind you to
          follow this rule.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Capitalization.
          </strong> “RabbitMQ” should always be capitalized and one
          words.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Adjectives.
          </strong> Use the RabbitMQ mark as an adjective, not a noun or
          verb.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        IMPROPER USE OF THE TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS.
      </strong> Use of the logos is
      reserved solely for use by VMware in its unaltered form. Examples of
      unauthorized use of the RabbitMQ trademarks include:

          <strong>
            Commercial Use:
          </strong> You may not use the RabbitMQ Marks in connection
          with commercial redistribution of RabbitMQ software (commercial
          redistribution includes, but is not limited to, redistribution in
          connection with any commercial business activities or
          revenue-generating business activities) regardless of whether the
          RabbitMQ software is unmodified.

        <p>
          <strong>
            Entity Names.
          </strong> You may not form a company, use a company name, or
          create a software product name that includes the “RabbitMQ”
          trademark, or implies any foundational or authorship role. If you
          have a software product that works with RabbitMQ, it is suggested
          you use terms such as ‘&lt;product name&gt; for RabbitMQ’ or
          ‘&lt;product name&gt;, RabbitMQ Edition.” If you wish to form an
          entity for a user or developer group, please contact us and we
          will be glad to discuss a license for a suitable name.

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Class or Quality.
          </strong> You may not imply that you are providing a
          class or quality of RabbitMQ (e.g., "enterprise-class" or
          "commercial quality") in a way that implies RabbitMQ is not of
          that class, grade or quality, nor that other parties are not of
          that class, grade, or quality.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Combinations.
          </strong> Use of the RabbitMQ Marks to identify software that
          combines any portion of the RabbitMQ software with any other
          software, unless the combined distribution is an official
          RabbitMQ distribution. For example, you may not distribute a
          combination of the RabbitMQ  software with software released by
          the Foobar project under the name “RabbitMQ Foobar Distro”.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            False or Misleading Statements.
          </strong> You may not make false or
          misleading statements regarding your use of RabbitMQ (e.g., "we
          wrote the majority of the code" or "we are major contributors" or
          "we are committers").
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Domain Names.
          </strong> You must not use RabbitMQ or any confusingly
          similar phrase in a domain name. For instance
          “www.rabbitmqhost.com” is not allowed. If you wish to use such a
          domain name for a non-commercial user or developer group to
          engage in community advocacy, please contact us and we will be
          glad to discuss a license for a suitable domain name.  Because of
          the many persons who, unfortunately, seek to spoof, swindle or
          deceive the community by using confusing domain names, we must be
          very strict about this rule.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Merchandise.
          </strong> You must not manufacture, sell or give away
          merchandise items, such as T-shirts and mugs, bearing the
          RabbitMQ logo, or create any mascot for the project.  If you wish
          to use the logo to do this for a non-commerical user or developer
          group to engage in community advocacy, please contact us and we
          will be glad to discuss a license to do this.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Variations, takeoffs or abbreviations.
          </strong> You may not use a
          variation of the RabbitMQ name or logo for any purpose other than
          common usage of these in community communications. For example,
          the following are not acceptable:
        </p>
        <ol class="roman">
          <li><p>RMQ</p></li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Endorsement or Sponsorship.
          </strong> You may not use the RabbitMQ
          trademarks in a manner that would imply VMware’s affiliation
          with or endorsement, sponsorship, or support of a product or
          service.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Rebranding.
          </strong> You may not change the trademark on unmodified
          RabbitMQ software to your own brand.  You may not hold yourself
          out as the source of the RabbitMQ software, except to the extent
          you have modified it as allowed under the Apache 2.0 license, and
          you make it clear that you are the source only of the
          modification.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Combination Marks.
          </strong> Do not use our trademarks in combination with
          any other marks or logos (for example Foobar RabbitMQ, or the
          name of your company or product typeset to look like the RabbitMQ
          logo).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Web Tags.
          </strong> Do not use the RabbitMQ trademark in a title or metatag
          of a web page to influence search engine rankings or result
          listings, rather than for discussion or advocacy of the RabbitMQ
          project.

  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>
        PROPER NOTICE AND ATTRIBUTION.
      </strong> The appropriate trademark symbol
      (i.e.,  ®) should appear at least with the first use of the RabbitMQ
      trademarks (for example, RABBITMQ®). When you use a RabbitMQ
      trademark you should include a statement attributing the trademark to
      VMware. For example, "RabbitMQ is a trademark of VMware,
      Inc. in the U.S. and other countries."
