# Protocol Extensions

## Overview

The RabbitMQ implements a number of extensions of the
[AMQP 0-9-1 specification](specification.html), which we
document here.

Some extensions introduce new protocol methods (operations); others rely on existing
extension points such as [optional queue arguments](/queues.html#optional-arguments).

## Publishing

 * [Publisher Confirms](/confirms.html) (aka Publisher Acknowledgements) are a lightweight way to know when
   RabbitMQ has taken responsibility for messages.
 * [Blocked Connection Notifications](/connection-blocked.html)
   allows clients to be notified when a connection is blocked and unblocked.

## Consuming

 * [Consumer Cancellation Notifications](/consumer-cancel.html) let a consumer know if it has been cancelled by the server.
 * [`basic.nack`](/nack.html) extends `basic.reject` to support rejecting multiple messages at once.
 * [Consumer Priorities](/consumer-priority.html) allow you to send messages to higher priority consumers first.
 * [Direct reply-to](/direct-reply-to.html) allows RPC clients to receive replies to their queries without needing
   to declare a temporary queue.

## Message Routing

 * [Exchange to Exchange Bindings](/e2e.html) allow
   messages to pass through multiple exchanges for more flexible routing.
 * [Alternate Exchanges](/ae.html) route messages that were otherwise unroutable.
 * [Sender-selected Distribution](/sender-selected.html) allows a publisher to decide where messages
   are routed directly.

## Message Lifecycle

 * [Per-Queue Message TTL](/ttl.html#per-queue-message-ttl)
   determines how long an unconsumed message can live in a queue before
   it is automatically deleted.
 * [Per-Message TTL](/ttl.html#per-message-ttl) determines the TTL on a per-message basis.
 * [Queue TTL](/ttl.html#queue-ttl) determines how
   long an unused queue can live before it is automatically deleted.
 * [Dead Letter Exchanges](/dlx.html) ensure messages get re-routed when they are rejected or expire.
 * [Queue Length Limit](maxlength.html) allows the maximum length of a queue to be set.
 * [Priority Queues](/priority.html) support the message priority field (in a slightly different way).

## Authentication and Identity

 * The [User-ID](/validated-user-id.html) message property is validated by the server.
 * Clients that advertise the appropriate capability may receive
   explicit [authentication failure notifications](/auth-notification.html) from the broker.
 * [`update-secret`](/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.update-secret)
   to be able to renew credentials for an active connection, when those credentials can expire.


## AMQP 0-9-1 Spec Differences

Some features that were in AMQP 0-8 were deprecated in AMQP
0-9-1. We have undeprecated some of them and introduced a
couple of tiny behaviour changes that improve usability of
the product. Please refer to the [spec differences](/spec-differences.html) page.

There's also an [AMQP 0-9-1 Errata page](/amqp-0-9-1-errata.html) which explains how various
